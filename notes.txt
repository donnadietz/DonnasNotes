I'm looking at CSC281 materials from Alex Godwin as I prepare to teach it in January.
Students first create GitHub, then get Git.
After this step, I downloaded and am attempting to use "GitHubDesktopSetup". 
I do not know how to create files from within GitHubDesktopSetup but I can create a publish
a repo. I was under the mistaken understanding that I was allowed private repos (for free) but
I was mistaken. Thus, everything I do is public. I will have to keep that in mind! 
I can see it through the Git Gui (the first item I downloaded) and when I click things,
it automatically launches (Notepad, what the system expects me to use to edit this.)
But this will be no good for editing code.  But it's a resource. Ok.

This is an edit from my laptop.
